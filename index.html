                        My name is Edel Marcelino and I have worked in the computer technology industry for over 15 years. I started out working as
                         a computer repair technician in college, then worked as a Systems Administrator intern during my senior year, until I 
                         graduated with my degree in Computer Engineering from SDSU. I have since worked as a Systems Engineer, Cybersecurity
                         Engineer, and Application Development Engineer.
                         <br><br>
